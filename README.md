# GO Face Blur
An app I wrote to blur faces

## About
- The app uses [Kagami]() to find faces in images.
- The app then tilizes the face using [this Library]()

## To run
1. Put an image in `IMAGES/IMAGE_IN`
2. Run the below command
> go run src/main.go (name of file without path to) 

↑ ↑ ↑ for example, if the file is called `image.jpg`, just put `image.jpg` not the `/path/to/image.jpg`↑ ↑ ↑ 

3. Check `IMAGES/IMAGE_OUT` for the result
